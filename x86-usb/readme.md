Its USB version of Arge OS(ArgOS)  

In this version the standart programs deleted, instead of programs in 1pa ill make the another commands.  

By The way: This version should be run without LBA or HBA in QEMU, you need run it with command like ```sh qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=naos.usb```  

fin.
